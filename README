This is a server C# library to send push notification via the Urban Airship http://urbanairship.com web service API.

Since there is no C# example listed on Urban Airship server library sample codes page (https://support.urbanairship.com/customer/portal/articles/60713-push-server-libraries). I decided to created this C# library to help .NET and C# developers to get thing started. 

The library handles:
basic push
pushing with tags
feedback service
